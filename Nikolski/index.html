Abstract:
</h3>
We discuss modern presentations of three basic applications of
Toeplitz determinants - Caratheodory-Gauss interpolation theorem,
Szegö-Weyl limit distribution of Toeplitz spectra, and Szegö-Onsager
second term asymptotics. No preliminary knowledge on Toeplitz
matrices/operators is supposed.
